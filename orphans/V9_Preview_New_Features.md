====================================

With this release, Volt MX Foundry introduces a set of incremental features described below. These features can be used with Iris V8 as well as the future release of V9 GA. The release of V9 Preview can be treated as laying the foundation of V9 GA, that will include additional Volt MX Foundry features. The V9 GA release is targeted for end of the first quarter of 2020 and you can view our [V9 Roadmap webinar on Basecamp](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm) for more details.

Console
-------

*   **Introduced Workflow**
    
    You can now visualize and design a backend process using Workflow, which justifies the low code concept. Design the backend workflow of an app by simply dragging and dropping the different types of nodes and connecting them as per the logic needed for the app. You can link a backend Workflow with an object either while creating the Workflow or through Object services.
    
    For more information about this feature, click [here](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Workflow.md).
    
*   **Rules-as-a-Service**
    
    Volt MX Foundry provides the ability to write business rules in a simplified text form by using the Rules-as-a-Service feature. The Rules service makes defining business logic closer to human language and is built using MVEL. Instead of embedding rules within Foundry integration services, with Rules as first-class service, the business logic and conditions are externalized and can be managed separately.
    
    For more information about this feature, click [here](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Rules_as_a_Service.md).
    
*   **Feature level access**
    
    Admins can restrict access to specific features of the Foundry environment, such as the App Services, Engagement services, Logging Console, etc.
    
    *   **Added support for a Build Client App only feature**
        
        The Build Client app role allows developers to build apps by pointing to a production environment from Volt MX Iris, without the ability to publish any services or access to the Foundry admin console. This effectively works like a read-only role for app developers.
        
    
    For more information about these features, click [here](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Settings_Cloud.md#users-cloud).
    
*   **Enhanced the security in the Volt MX app by adding support for primary and secondary appkey and appsecret.**
    
    The primary and secondary keys are packaged with the web and native channels respectively when their apps are built in Volt MX Iris.
    
    *   **Added ability to rotate appkeys**
        
        Different appkeys for web and native with the ability to rotate keys.
