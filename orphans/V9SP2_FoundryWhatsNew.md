*   **Enhancements to Workflow Audit history**
    
    The Workflow Audit history has been enhanced for the following:
    
    *   Added support to **manually retry a failed task** in a workflow along with **Editing** the payload via namespaces. This is a runtime edit to the erroneous payload and helps retry the failed task in a workflow and resume execution from point of failure.

    *   Added support to display the Correlation ID values in case of Event triggered workflows.

*   **Enhancements to Foundry application Publish**
    
    *   The Publish section has been enhanced to display environments status such as Available, Busy, and Unknown. This is a quick feedback mechanism to inform a user in case the server is busy publishing another application.
    *   Added incremental application publish support to significantly reduce the publish time of an app after the first publish.
    *   Added a new reconfiguration option to skip swagger generation steps during publish.
    *   Improved error messaging in case of publish failures.

*   **Added a new application Promotion Mechanism**
    
    From Volt MX Foundry V9 SP2 onwards, a new application promotion mechanism is introduced. From the snapshot page of an environment, a user can download a deployment package containing the application archive at the publish time and reconfiguration file. The Deployment package can be directly promoted to an environment without being impacted by the changes in console

*   **Support for PKCE in OAuth 2.0 Identity Providers**
    
    From Volt MX Foundry V9 SP2 onwards, all OAuth Identity providers support PKCE (proof key for code exchange) in authorization code flow. For backend Identity providers that support PKCE, Iris SDK and Identity will honor additional PKCE mechanism implicitly without any code changes. For the providers that do not support PKCE or in case of clients that use Volt MX V9.1 or lesser, the authorization code grant flow will continue to be honored without the PKCE enhancement.

*   **Support for Refresh Token Grant type in OAuth 2.0 Identity Providers**
    
    From Volt MX Foundry V9 SP2 onwards, Refresh Token Grant Type support is added for OAuth 2.0 Identity services. The Refresh Token grant type is used by clients to exchange a refresh token for an access token when the access token has expired. This allows clients to continue to have a valid access token without further interaction with the user. A new Refresh login API is added in SDK to support the refresh login flow.
