==================================================

Fixed Issues
------------

*   Fixed an issue due to which empty spaces were trimmed in a backend response. Backend responses will now include empty space if they have any.
*   Fixed an issue due to which if a charset is present in the application/json content type and a special character is present in the payload then the data gets encoded before being send to the backend.
*   Fixed an issue with the distributed session where backend cookies were not being sent in subsequent calls.
*   Enhanced Foundry performance while using Redis cache as cache provider by compressing/decompressing data while storing/retrieving a large payload.

*   **For Cloud**: Raise a cloud upgrade request.
