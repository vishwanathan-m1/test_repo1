Volt MX  Foundry SDK
------------------

*   **Updating a back-end environment**
    
    If the server URL has changed for the client, a manual update is needed to honor the updated back-end environment.
    
    For more information about this feature, click [here](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXStudio/Initializing_VoltMX_JS_Client_SDK_Iris.md).
    
*   **Allowing the versioning of an application with updated artifacts**
    
    When the Iris app is linked with the Foundry app, it fetches the service doc and bundles it with the application. When the Foundry app is re-published and a call is made to the Identity Server, the SDK detects the changes. It replaces the bundled service doc with the new service doc.
