------------------------------

*   **Enhanced Workflow**
    
    *   From Volt MX Foundry V9.0.1, the Workflow Audit history has been enhanced with the capability to manually retry a failed task in Workflow. Users with admin access can view the error details of the failed task and do a read-only **Retry** of that task. After the task is successfully executed, the workflow will resume and proceed to execute the next task.
